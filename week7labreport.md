### CSE Labs Done Quick


#### Task 1. Delete existing forks of the repository

I used the keys `<ctrl-R> r <enter>` to remove the lab7 repository from my local computer, and also deleted the repository from my Github account through my browser. This gave me the command `rm -rf ~/lab7` by autocompleting the most recent command I used which started with the letter "r".


#### Task 2. Fork the repository

I forked the repository directly from Github in my web browser by pressing the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This added the repository to my personal Github account so I can now access its files and directories.

#### Task 3. Start the timer

I started a stopwatch from Google to keep track of how long each of the tasks would take me to do.

#### Task 4. Log into `ieng6`

Now we're actually getting into the lab tasks! I logged into my CSE 15l account on `ieng6` by pressing the keys `<up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`, which gave me the `ssh <myaccount>@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command. This command was 6 up in my search history, so I used the up arrow to access and enter it. I had previously set up an `ssh` key for my `ieng6` account so I did not have to enter my password upon logging in.

#### Task 5. Clone the repository fork from your Github account

I manually entered the command to clone this repository just because I wanted to make sure I had the right SSH key for the repository. The command I used was `git clone <SSH link>` and I got the SSH link directly from Github.
